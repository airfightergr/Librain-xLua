#### CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES

If you want to contribute to this project, please follow the guidelines below:

###### REPOSITORY RULES 
* Fork the current repo, and do any changes to your fork.

* When done, do a pull request with a detailed list of the changes/additions you have made. Non detailed pull requests will be rejected immediately.

* The repo is set up in a way that mirrors X-Plane folder structure. For Laminar's aircraft, `Laminar Research` and `Extra Aircraft`, all required folder structure is already in place.

* For 3rd party aircraft, add a folder for each aircraft inside the `3rd Party Aircraft` folder. Mirror the folder structure of each aircraft.

* Use the file `placeholder` in any empty folder you create, to maintain folder structure in github as well. It is a text file with a single word, which easily can be removed for the releases.

###### LICENCING RULES
* Regarding 3rd party aircraft, payware of freeware, **each contributor is responsible for any licencing issues!** I don't accept any responsibility for that issue!

* If you adding a 3rd party aircraft, you are accepting the rules below:
    1. You have the full responsibility of your contribution, that does not break any licence or EULA, as set by the original developer/distributor.
    2. You must include on the aircraft's top folder a text file named `Licence.txt` with all information regarding the licencing situation of the aircraft. Contributions that will not have such file, will be rejected!

###### SOURCE MATERIAL RULES
The scope of this repo is to allow anyone who wants to add or improve to be able to do so. For that reason, you must follow the rules below:
* All source materials (3D files, textures, scripts, etc.) must be included in your commits.
* 3D source file should be, preferably for **Blender**. Files from other 3D programs will be accepted.
* Blender files must be for **Blender 2.80 or above**. Since from now on this is the new standard, we must transit to this workflow.

###### RELEASE PACKAGING RULES
* Each pull request must have a link to download the release version for each aircraft. Use any service you like (Google drive, Dropbox, Mega, ect.). This package must be clear of all unnecessary files for the final user (like source files).
* I will download and repack everything, so will be 1 download file for all aircraft.
* For 3rd party aircraft, you must include an `Installation.txt` file, with all steps required for successful installation.
* For Laminar's aircraft, must maintain X-Plane's structure, so the user be able to unzip the downloaded file on X-Plane's main folder and all files go to the right places.
